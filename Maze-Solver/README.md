#Maze-Solver

This is a Maze Solver solved using three different algorithms: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search and A\* algorithm.

DFS does not give the shortest path whereas the other algorithms do.

Mazes are in the "Mazes" folder. Compile the program and pass the filename of the Maze to std::cin via the redirect operator in the command line as below:

** ./a.out < Mazes/maze1.txt **
