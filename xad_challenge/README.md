# xad_challenge
This is a program written for a coding challenge from xAd Inc. Problem statement: Implement a program in C or C++ that does the following:  Given a list of objects, we would like to know the number of objects that lies in a range of values.  The list of objects doesn't change after the first time (i.e no objects are added, removed or changed. Hence you should optimize the data structure for reads and not worry about updates).  For example: Assume the list of objects are random 10 million integers. An example query might be like "get number of objects >1000" or "get number of objects >10000 and &lt;120000”  or "get number of objects = 1000”. The objects should have a comparison operator defined.  Write few test cases with different types of objects(integers, floats, strings, user defined data type) of lengths from 10K to 100M, and print out the time taken (in microseconds) for few sample representative queries.
